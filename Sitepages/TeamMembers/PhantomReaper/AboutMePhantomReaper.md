# About Me Phantom Reaper
Hello, I am **Phantom Reaper** the ***Founder*** and ***CEO*** of ***Phantom Reaper Studios***. I created this Studio because of two reasons. I believe that everyone should be able to share their work to the world in any way. The Other reason is because I have a friend that is a very good artist, but they are shy. This person only hangs out with a small group of pepole (ofcourse Im one of them) and they are very new to this kind of enviroment that they are in now, while the most of the others in this group have been in this type of place most of their life. This person also has had somthing very tragic happen to them recently and very few in our group of pepole know what they are going through and what it feels like. I sadly know how this feel and see how they use art as a ventilation of their emotions. So I came up with the idea to make this studio and once I get this website up and running I will show this person and let them express themselves through this site.
  I think that is enough sadness for right now, so now time to tell you about my self. I like to make art, Im not very good at coming up with my own Ideas, but I can look at a picture and draw it pretty close without tracing, I am also good at pixel art. I like to remix, make mash-ups, and would one day have a small band to cover songs. I am currently taking colliage classes on coding to make it easier for me to make programs and games. After I get done with my programing degree I am going to go serve my country and go into the millitary. I like to play video-games and like to make small mods that makes my playthroughs easier. I love animals mostly dogs though and I have two big dogs.
